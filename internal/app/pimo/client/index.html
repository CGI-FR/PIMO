    <!--
        This folder should contains the PIMO Play website <b>before</b> compiling the `pimo` binary file.

        This can be achieved in 2 ways :
        - use the `neon build-web` command : this will build the static website and copy it into this directory
        - use the `neon release` command : this will trigger the `neon build-web` then compile binay for production release

        DO NOT COMMIT THE GENERATED STATIC WEBSITE
    -->
    <div>
        If you see this page when using a PIMO binary file and the `pimo play` command, then it means the binary was misbuilt : please <a href="https://github.com/CGI-FR/PIMO/issues/new">report an issue</a> to the team!
